# Improving the Views in the Application&#x20;

## **Module Introduction**

This module provides an in-depth guide to enhancing the views in an ASP.NET Core application tailored for the logistics domain. By leveraging features like partial views, view components, and custom tag helpers, you will learn to build a scalable and maintainable user interface. Examples are contextualized for logistics businesses, such as shipment tracking and inventory management. By the end of this module, you will have the skills to:

- Implement partial views for reusable UI elements.
- Create and integrate a batch operation feature for managing bulk logistics tasks.
- Use view components for dynamic data rendering.
- Build custom tag helpers for reusable HTML logic.

Letâ€™s dive into the module with a logistics-focused application.

## **Using Partial Views**

Partial views are reusable fragments of UI logic encapsulated in Razor views. They are ideal for avoiding code duplication and simplifying complex views.

### **Why Use Partial Views in Logistics?**

In logistics applications, you may have repeated UI elements like shipment cards or inventory item listings. Partial views allow these components to be reused across pages.

#### **Example: Shipment Card**

Imagine two pages: a shipment overview and a delivery status dashboard. Both display shipment details in a card format. Instead of duplicating code, use a partial view:

1. **Create a Partial View:**
   Save the view as `_ShipmentCard.cshtml` in the `Views/Shared` folder:

   ```html
   @model Shipment

   <div class="card mb-3">
       <div class="card-header">
           @Model.Id - @Model.Description
       </div>
       <div class="card-body">
           <p><strong>Status:</strong> @Model.Status</p>
           <p><strong>Delivery Date:</strong> @Model.DeliveryDate.ToShortDateString()</p>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Integrate Partial View in Parent Views:**
   In `Shipment/List.cshtml`:

   ```html
   @model IEnumerable<Shipment>

   @foreach (var shipment in Model)
   {
       <partial name="_ShipmentCard" model="shipment" />
   }
   ```

#### **Benefits:**

- Centralized updates: Modify `_ShipmentCard.cshtml` to reflect changes across all pages.
- Cleaner parent views.

## **Creating a Batch Operation Feature**

Batch operation features are essential in logistics for efficiently managing tasks such as bulk status updates or assigning shipments to drivers.

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Define the Model:**

   ```csharp
   public class BatchOperationItem
   {
       public int Id { get; set; }
       public Shipment Shipment { get; set; }
       public string OperationType { get; set; }
   }
   ```

2. **Repository and Batch Management Logic:**
   Use a service to manage batch operations:

   ```csharp
   public class BatchOperationService
   {
       private readonly List<BatchOperationItem> _batchItems = new();

       public void AddToBatch(Shipment shipment, string operationType)
       {
           var item = _batchItems.FirstOrDefault(i => i.Shipment.Id == shipment.Id);
           if (item == null)
           {
               _batchItems.Add(new BatchOperationItem { Shipment = shipment, OperationType = operationType });
           }
           else
           {
               item.OperationType = operationType;
           }
       }

       public IEnumerable<BatchOperationItem> GetBatchItems() => _batchItems;

       public void ExecuteBatch()
       {
           foreach (var item in _batchItems)
           {
               // Execute operation logic (e.g., updating status)
           }

           _batchItems.Clear();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Create a Controller and View:**
   **Controller:**

   ```csharp
   public class BatchController : Controller
   {
       private readonly BatchOperationService _batchService;

       public BatchController(BatchOperationService batchService)
       {
           _batchService = batchService;
       }

       public IActionResult Index()
       {
           var items = _batchService.GetBatchItems();
           return View(items);
       }

       public IActionResult Execute()
       {
           _batchService.ExecuteBatch();
           return RedirectToAction("Index");
       }
   }
   ```

   **View:**

   ```html
   @model IEnumerable<BatchOperationItem>

   <h1>Batch Operations</h1>
   <table class="table">
       <thead>
           <tr>
               <th>Shipment</th>
               <th>Operation</th>
           </tr>
       </thead>
       <tbody>
           @foreach (var item in Model)
           {
               <tr>
                   <td>@item.Shipment.Description</td>
                   <td>@item.OperationType</td>
               </tr>
           }
       </tbody>
   </table>
   <form method="post" asp-action="Execute">
       <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Execute Batch</button>
   </form>
   ```

## **Working with View Components**

View components allow for encapsulating dynamic UI logic with a backing C# class. Unlike partial views, they can fetch and process data independently.

### **Logistics Use Case: Shipment Summary Widget**

Display the total number of shipments and pending deliveries across all pages.

1. **Create the View Component Class:**

   ```csharp
   public class ShipmentSummaryViewComponent : ViewComponent
   {
       private readonly IShipmentRepository _repository;

       public ShipmentSummaryViewComponent(IShipmentRepository repository)
       {
           _repository = repository;
       }

       public IViewComponentResult Invoke()
       {
           var summary = new ShipmentSummaryViewModel
           {
               TotalShipments = _repository.GetAllShipments().Count(),
               PendingDeliveries = _repository.GetAllShipments().Count(s => s.Status == "Pending")
           };

           return View(summary);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Create the View:**
   Save as `Views/Shared/Components/ShipmentSummary/Default.cshtml`:

   ```html
   @model ShipmentSummaryViewModel

   <div>
       <p>Total Shipments: @Model.TotalShipments</p>
       <p>Pending Deliveries: @Model.PendingDeliveries</p>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Use the View Component:**
   Add to a layout:

   ```html
   <vc:shipment-summary />
   ```

## **Creating Custom Tag Helpers**

Tag helpers encapsulate reusable HTML generation logic in Razor.

### **Example: Highlight Overdue Shipments**

1. **Create the Tag Helper Class:**

   ```csharp
   [HtmlTargetElement("highlight-overdue")]
   public class HighlightOverdueTagHelper : TagHelper
   {
       public DateTime DeliveryDate { get; set; }

       public override void Process(TagHelperContext context, TagHelperOutput output)
       {
           output.TagName = "span";
           if (DeliveryDate < DateTime.Now)
           {
               output.Attributes.SetAttribute("class", "text-danger");
           }
           output.Content.SetContent("Overdue");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Use the Tag Helper in a View:**

   ```html
   @foreach (var shipment in Model)
   {
       <p>@shipment.Description: <highlight-overdue delivery-date="@shipment.DeliveryDate"></highlight-overdue></p>
   }
   ```

3. **Result:**
   Overdue shipments are highlighted in red.
