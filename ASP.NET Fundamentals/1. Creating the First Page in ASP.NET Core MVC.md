# Creating the First Page in ASP.NET Core MVC for Logistics

## **Introduction**

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on creating the first page of a logistics application using ASP.NET Core MVC. By the end of this guide, you will understand the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, implement dynamic pages, and use Razor views effectively. This guide focuses on the logistics domain, making examples and applications directly relevant.

## **Understanding the MVC Pattern**

The MVC pattern divides an application into three interconnected components:

1. **Model**: Represents the application's data and business logic.
2. **View**: Displays data to the user.
3. **Controller**: Handles user input, communicates with the model, and selects views to render.

### **Key Benefits**

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps UI, logic, and data management distinct.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies debugging and future enhancements.
- **Testability**: Allows unit testing of individual components.

For example, in a logistics application:

- The **Model** defines `Shipment` and `Category` entities.
- The **View** presents shipment lists.
- The **Controller** retrieves data and maps it to the view.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. Setting Up the Project**

1. **Create a New ASP.NET Core MVC Project**:

   ```bash
   dotnet new mvc -n LogisticsApp
   ```

2. **Define the Folder Structure**:
   - `Models`: For domain classes like `Shipment` and `Category`.
   - `Controllers`: For request-handling logic.
   - `Views`: For UI templates.

---

### **2. Implementing the Model**

The model includes domain classes and repository interfaces.

#### **Example: Shipment Class**

```csharp
public class Shipment
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public DateTime DeliveryDate { get; set; }
    public string Status { get; set; }
    public Category Category { get; set; }
}

public class Category
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

#### **Repository Interface**

```csharp
public interface IShipmentRepository
{
    IEnumerable<Shipment> GetAllShipments();
    Shipment GetShipmentById(int id);
}
```

#### **Mock Repository Implementation**

```csharp
public class MockShipmentRepository : IShipmentRepository
{
    private List<Shipment> _shipments = new List<Shipment>
    {
        new Shipment { Id = 1, Description = "Electronics", DeliveryDate = DateTime.Today, Status = "Pending", Category = new Category { Id = 1, Name = "Fragile" } },
        new Shipment { Id = 2, Description = "Clothing", DeliveryDate = DateTime.Today.AddDays(2), Status = "Shipped", Category = new Category { Id = 2, Name = "Regular" } }
    };

    public IEnumerable<Shipment> GetAllShipments() => _shipments;
    public Shipment GetShipmentById(int id) => _shipments.FirstOrDefault(s => s.Id == id);
}
```

Register the repository in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IShipmentRepository, MockShipmentRepository>();
```

---

### **3. Creating the Controller**

Controllers handle user interactions and direct traffic.

#### **Example: ShipmentController**

```csharp
public class ShipmentController : Controller
{
    private readonly IShipmentRepository _shipmentRepository;

    public ShipmentController(IShipmentRepository shipmentRepository)
    {
        _shipmentRepository = shipmentRepository;
    }

    public IActionResult List()
    {
        var shipments = _shipmentRepository.GetAllShipments();
        return View(shipments);
    }
}
```

---

### **4. Adding the View**

Views are Razor templates that render HTML content dynamically.

#### **Create a View for Shipment List**

1. Add a `Views/Shipment` folder.
2. Create a `List.cshtml` file.

#### **Dynamic View Example**

```html
@model IEnumerable<Shipment>

<h1>Shipment List</h1>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Delivery Date</th>
            <th>Status</th>
            <th>Category</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var shipment in Model)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>@shipment.Id</td>
                <td>@shipment.Description</td>
                <td>@shipment.DeliveryDate.ToShortDateString()</td>
                <td>@shipment.Status</td>
                <td>@shipment.Category.Name</td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

#### **Access the View**

Run the application and navigate to `/Shipment/List`.

---

### **5. Styling the View**

Add Bootstrap for professional styling.

#### **Add Bootstrap via Library Manager**

1. Right-click the project and select **Add > Client-Side Library**.
2. Search for `bootstrap` and install it in the `wwwroot/lib/bootstrap` folder.

#### **Link CSS in Layout**

Update `_Layout.cshtml`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
```

#### **Apply Bootstrap Classes**

Enhance the shipment table:

```html
<table class="table table-striped">
    <thead class="thead-dark">
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Delivery Date</th>
            <th>Status</th>
            <th>Category</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        @foreach (var shipment in Model)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>@shipment.Id</td>
                <td>@shipment.Description</td>
                <td>@shipment.DeliveryDate.ToShortDateString()</td>
                <td>@shipment.Status</td>
                <td>@shipment.Category.Name</td>
            </tr>
        }
    </tbody>
</table>
```

## **Conclusion**

Congratulations! You’ve created a dynamic page for a logistics application using ASP.NET Core MVC. By separating concerns into models, views, and controllers, you’ve ensured maintainability and scalability. In the next module, we’ll connect the application to a real database using Entity Framework Core.
