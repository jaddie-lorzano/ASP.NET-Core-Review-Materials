# Adding Routes and Navigation

## **Module Introduction**

Routing and navigation are fundamental to web applications, enabling users to move between different pages seamlessly. In this module, weâ€™ll explore how to implement routing and navigation in an ASP.NET Core application tailored to logistics scenarios. Topics include:

- Understanding ASP.NET Core routing and endpoints.
- Configuring custom routes.
- Implementing navigation with tag helpers.
- Practical logistics examples, such as navigating shipment details and managing delivery dashboards.

By the end, you will be able to create a logistics application with structured navigation and routing tailored to specific business requirements.

## **Understanding ASP.NET Core Routing**

Routing in ASP.NET Core maps incoming HTTP requests to endpoints, such as controllers and actions. For logistics applications, this means mapping URLs to shipment details, inventory lists, or task management pages.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Endpoints**: The destinations for HTTP requests, such as controller actions or Razor Pages.
2. **Routing Middleware**: Processes requests and determines the endpoint based on the route configuration.
3. **Route Patterns**: Templates used to match URLs, often defined in `Program.cs` using methods like `MapControllerRoute`.

### **Basic Example**

In a logistics application, a URL like `/Shipment/Details/1` maps to the `Details` action in the `ShipmentController` with an ID parameter.

```csharp
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
```

This route defines:

- A default controller (`Home`) and action (`Index`).
- An optional `id` parameter.

## **Configuring Routes for Logistics Applications**

### **Default Routing**

Default routes are sufficient for simple logistics applications. For instance:

```csharp
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Shipment}/{action=List}/{id?}");
```

This configuration:

- Maps `/Shipment/List` to the `List` action in `ShipmentController`.
- Makes the `id` parameter optional for flexibility.

### **Custom Routes**

Custom routes handle specialized requirements, such as filtering shipments by status:

```csharp
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "filterByStatus",
    pattern: "Shipment/{action}/{status}",
    defaults: new { controller = "Shipment", action = "List" });
```

Now, a URL like `/Shipment/List/Delivered` invokes the `List` action and passes `Delivered` as the `status` parameter.

### **Route Constraints**

Add constraints to enforce parameter types, ensuring robustness:

```csharp
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "shipmentDetails",
    pattern: "Shipment/Details/{id:int}",
    defaults: new { controller = "Shipment", action = "Details" });
```

Here, the `id` parameter must be an integer.

## **Implementing Navigation with Tag Helpers**

Tag helpers simplify navigation by dynamically generating links based on routes. This is especially useful in logistics applications with dynamic data.

### **Example: Navigating Shipment Details**

#### **Controller Action**

```csharp
public IActionResult Details(int id)
{
    var shipment = _shipmentRepository.GetShipmentById(id);
    if (shipment == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }
    return View(shipment);
}
```

#### **View with Tag Helpers**

```html
@foreach (var shipment in Model)
{
    <a asp-controller="Shipment" asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="@shipment.Id">
        @shipment.Description
    </a>
}
```

This generates links like `/Shipment/Details/1`, ensuring navigation to the correct details page.

### **Dynamic Menu Example**

For a navigation menu filtering shipments by status:

```html
<ul>
    <li><a asp-controller="Shipment" asp-action="List" asp-route-status="Pending">Pending</a></li>
    <li><a asp-controller="Shipment" asp-action="List" asp-route-status="Delivered">Delivered</a></li>
    <li><a asp-controller="Shipment" asp-action="List" asp-route-status="Cancelled">Cancelled</a></li>
</ul>
```

This dynamically generates URLs like `/Shipment/List/Pending`.

## **Case Study: Logistics Dashboard Navigation**

### **Scenario**

A logistics company needs a dashboard for:

- Viewing all shipments.
- Accessing shipment details.
- Filtering shipments by status.

### **Solution Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Define Routes**

In `Program.cs`:

```csharp
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "dashboard",
    pattern: "Dashboard/{action}/{status?}",
    defaults: new { controller = "Dashboard", action = "Index" });
```

#### **Step 2: Build Controller**

```csharp
public class DashboardController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var shipments = _shipmentRepository.GetAllShipments();
        return View(shipments);
    }

    public IActionResult Filter(string status)
    {
        var shipments = _shipmentRepository.GetShipmentsByStatus(status);
        return View("Index", shipments);
    }
}
```

#### **Step 3: Create Views**

**Index.cshtml**:

```html
@foreach (var shipment in Model)
{
    <tr>
        <td>@shipment.Description</td>
        <td>@shipment.Status</td>
        <td><a asp-controller="Shipment" asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="@shipment.Id">Details</a></td>
    </tr>
}
```

**Navigation Links**:

```html
<ul>
    <li><a asp-controller="Dashboard" asp-action="Filter" asp-route-status="Pending">Pending</a></li>
    <li><a asp-controller="Dashboard" asp-action="Filter" asp-route-status="Delivered">Delivered</a></li>
    <li><a asp-controller="Dashboard" asp-action="Filter" asp-route-status="Cancelled">Cancelled</a></li>
</ul>
```
