# Creating a RESTful API with Attribute Routing in ASP.NET Core

This handout provides a detailed guide on creating a RESTful API in ASP.NET Core with a focus on using **attribute routing**. Examples are tailored to a logistics business domain to demonstrate real-world use cases.

---

## **1. What is a RESTful API?**

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is a web service that enables applications to communicate over HTTP by leveraging standardized methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. REST APIs typically return data in JSON or XML formats, making them easy to integrate with various clients like web apps, mobile apps, or third-party services.

### **Use Cases in Logistics:**

- Retrieve shipment details by tracking number.
- Create new shipment records.
- Update the delivery status of shipments.
- Delete outdated or incorrect records.

---

## **2. Setting Up an ASP.NET Core RESTful API**

### **2.1 Creating the API Controller**

Controllers in ASP.NET Core manage incoming HTTP requests and return appropriate responses. For an API, the `[ApiController]` attribute simplifies common tasks such as model validation.

#### Example: Shipments Controller

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ShipmentsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IShipmentService _shipmentService;

    public ShipmentsController(IShipmentService shipmentService)
    {
        _shipmentService = shipmentService;
    }

    [HttpGet("{trackingNumber}")]
    public IActionResult GetShipment(string trackingNumber)
    {
        var shipment = _shipmentService.GetByTrackingNumber(trackingNumber);
        if (shipment == null)
            return NotFound();

        return Ok(shipment);
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult CreateShipment([FromBody] ShipmentDto shipmentDto)
    {
        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
            return BadRequest(ModelState);

        var createdShipment = _shipmentService.Add(shipmentDto);
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetShipment), new { trackingNumber = createdShipment.TrackingNumber }, createdShipment);
    }
}
```

---

### **2.2 Configuring the Program.cs**

Ensure the API is properly registered in the middleware pipeline.

#### Example

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container
builder.Services.AddControllers();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline
app.UseRouting();
app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```

---

## **3. Attribute Routing for APIs**

Attribute routing allows developers to define API routes directly on controller methods using attributes like `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, `[HttpPut]`, and `[HttpDelete]`. This approach provides greater flexibility and readability compared to conventional routing.

### **3.1 Examples of Attribute Routing in Logistics**

#### Retrieve Shipment Details

```csharp
[HttpGet("{trackingNumber}")]
public IActionResult GetShipment(string trackingNumber)
{
    var shipment = _shipmentService.GetByTrackingNumber(trackingNumber);
    if (shipment == null)
        return NotFound();

    return Ok(shipment);
}
```

- **Use Case**: Fetch shipment details by tracking number.
- **Example Request**: `GET /api/shipments/TRK12345`
- **Response**:

  ```json
  {
      "trackingNumber": "TRK12345",
      "origin": "Los Angeles",
      "destination": "New York",
      "status": "In Transit"
  }
  ```

#### Create a New Shipment

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult CreateShipment([FromBody] ShipmentDto shipmentDto)
{
    if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        return BadRequest(ModelState);

    var createdShipment = _shipmentService.Add(shipmentDto);
    return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetShipment), new { trackingNumber = createdShipment.TrackingNumber }, createdShipment);
}
```

- **Use Case**: Add a new shipment record.
- **Example Request**: `POST /api/shipments`
- **Request Body**:

  ```json
  {
      "origin": "Los Angeles",
      "destination": "New York",
      "weight": 10.5,
      "carrier": "FedEx"
  }
  ```

- **Response**:

  ```json
  {
      "trackingNumber": "TRK98765",
      "origin": "Los Angeles",
      "destination": "New York",
      "status": "Created"
  }
  ```

#### Update Shipment Status

```csharp
[HttpPut("{trackingNumber}/status")]
public IActionResult UpdateStatus(string trackingNumber, [FromBody] StatusUpdateDto statusUpdate)
{
    var updated = _shipmentService.UpdateStatus(trackingNumber, statusUpdate);
    if (!updated)
        return NotFound();

    return NoContent();
}
```

- **Use Case**: Update the status of an existing shipment.
- **Example Request**: `PUT /api/shipments/TRK12345/status`
- **Request Body**:

  ```json
  {
      "status": "Delivered"
  }
  ```

- **Response**: Status Code `204 No Content`

#### Delete a Shipment Record

```csharp
[HttpDelete("{trackingNumber}")]
public IActionResult DeleteShipment(string trackingNumber)
{
    var deleted = _shipmentService.Delete(trackingNumber);
    if (!deleted)
        return NotFound();

    return NoContent();
}
```

- **Use Case**: Remove outdated or incorrect shipment records.
- **Example Request**: `DELETE /api/shipments/TRK12345`
- **Response**: Status Code `204 No Content`

## **4. Error Handling in APIs**

Proper error handling improves the API's reliability and usability.

### Common Error Responses

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side issue.

#### Example of Handling Errors

```csharp
[HttpGet("{trackingNumber}")]
public IActionResult GetShipment(string trackingNumber)
{
    try
    {
        var shipment = _shipmentService.GetByTrackingNumber(trackingNumber);
        if (shipment == null)
            return NotFound();

        return Ok(shipment);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // Log the error
        return StatusCode(500, "An error occurred while processing your request.");
    }
}
```

---

## **5. Best Practices**

- **Use Meaningful Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/shipments/{trackingNumber}`
  - `POST /api/shipments`
  - `PUT /api/shipments/{trackingNumber}/status`
  - `DELETE /api/shipments/{trackingNumber}`
- **Return Proper Status Codes**:
  - `200 OK`: Request succeeded.
  - `201 Created`: Resource created.
  - `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
  - `400 Bad Request`: Input validation failed.
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: Unhandled exception.
- **Validate Input**:
  - Use `[ApiController]` for automatic validation.
  - Ensure DTOs include validation attributes.
- **Use Dependency Injection**:
  - Services like `IShipmentService` keep logic clean and testable.

## **6. Summary**

Creating a RESTful API with attribute routing in ASP.NET Core allows for efficient and flexible development of web services. For a logistics business, APIs provide a scalable solution for managing shipments, updating statuses, and integrating with third-party systems. With proper routing, error handling, and adherence to REST principles, APIs can significantly enhance the user experience and operational efficiency.
