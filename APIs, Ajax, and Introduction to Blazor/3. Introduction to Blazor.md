# Introduction to Blazor: Key Concepts & A Simple Blazor Component Demo

Blazor is a modern web framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive web applications using C# and HTML. It eliminates the need for JavaScript for many tasks, making it an attractive choice for .NET developers.

---

## **1. Key Concepts in Blazor**

### **1.1 What is Blazor?**

Blazor is a framework for building interactive web UIs using C#. It uses Razor syntax to combine HTML and C# logic. Blazor can run in two primary modes:

- **Blazor Server**: The application logic runs on the server, and the UI updates are sent to the client through a SignalR connection.
- **Blazor WebAssembly (WASM)**: The application runs entirely in the browser using WebAssembly.

### **1.2 Core Features of Blazor**

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Applications are built using reusable components.
- **Two-Way Data Binding**: Simplifies synchronizing data between the UI and the application.
- **Dependency Injection**: Enables easy service injection for better modularity.
- **Event Handling**: Handles UI events seamlessly using C#.

### **1.3 Why Blazor?**

- Write full-stack web applications entirely in C#.
- Leverage the .NET ecosystem, including libraries and tools.
- Simplify development by sharing code between the client and server.

### **1.4 Use Cases in Logistics**

- Building shipment tracking portals.
- Interactive dashboards for warehouse management.
- Real-time updates for delivery status.

## **2. Anatomy of a Blazor Component**

A Blazor component is a self-contained block of UI. It consists of:

- **Markup**: HTML for the UI layout.
- **C# Logic**: Code to handle application logic.

### **Basic Structure**

A Blazor component is typically defined in a `.razor` file:

```razor
@page "/counter"

<h3>Counter</h3>

<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

<button @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
```

- **`@page`**: Defines the route to access the component.
- **Markup**: Contains the HTML structure.
- **`@code` Block**: Holds the C# logic.

## **3. A Simple Blazor Component Demo**

### **Objective:**

Create a shipment tracker search feature where users can search for shipments by tracking number and view the results dynamically.

### **3.1 Setting Up the Environment**

- Install .NET SDK 6.0 or later.
- Create a new Blazor Server app using Visual Studio or the CLI:

  ```bash
  dotnet new blazorserver -n LogisticsTracker
  ```

### **3.2 Creating the Shipment Search Component**

#### **3.2.1 Define the Component**

Create a new Razor component named `ShipmentSearch.razor`:

```razor
@page "/shipment-search"

<h3>Shipment Search</h3>

<div>
    <input type="text" @bind="SearchQuery" placeholder="Enter tracking number" />
    <button @onclick="SearchShipments">Search</button>
</div>

@if (SearchResults == null)
{
    <p>Enter a tracking number to see results.</p>
}
else if (!SearchResults.Any())
{
    <p>No shipments found.</p>
}
else
{
    <ul>
        @foreach (var shipment in SearchResults)
        {
            <li>
                <b>@shipment.TrackingNumber</b>: @shipment.Status (from @shipment.Origin to @shipment.Destination)
            </li>
        }
    </ul>
}

@code {
    private string SearchQuery = string.Empty;
    private List<Shipment> SearchResults;

    private async Task SearchShipments()
    {
        // Simulating a service call
        await Task.Delay(500); // Simulate async call

        // Example data (Replace with API call in a real app)
        var mockData = new List<Shipment>
        {
            new Shipment { TrackingNumber = "TRK12345", Origin = "New York", Destination = "Los Angeles", Status = "In Transit" },
            new Shipment { TrackingNumber = "TRK67890", Origin = "Chicago", Destination = "Miami", Status = "Delivered" }
        };

        SearchResults = mockData
            .Where(s => s.TrackingNumber.Contains(SearchQuery, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
            .ToList();
    }

    public class Shipment
    {
        public string TrackingNumber { get; set; }
        public string Origin { get; set; }
        public string Destination { get; set; }
        public string Status { get; set; }
    }
}
```

#### **3.2.2 Add Navigation to the Component**

Update the `NavMenu.razor` to include a link to the shipment search page:

```razor
<li class="nav-item px-3">
    <NavLink class="nav-link" href="/shipment-search">
        <span class="oi oi-magnifying-glass" aria-hidden="true"></span> Shipment Search
    </NavLink>
</li>
```

### **3.3 Running the Application**

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

2. Navigate to `/shipment-search` in your browser.
3. Test the search functionality by entering a tracking number.

## **4. Extending the Component**

### **4.1 Connect to an API**

Replace the mock data with a real API call:

```razor
private async Task SearchShipments()
{
    var client = new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.logistics.com/") };
    SearchResults = await client.GetFromJsonAsync<List<Shipment>>($"shipments/search?query={SearchQuery}");
}
```

### **4.2 Add Validation**

Ensure the user enters a valid tracking number:

```razor
if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(SearchQuery))
{
    // Show an error message
    return;
}
```

## **5. Summary**

This demo introduced the core concepts of Blazor and demonstrated building a simple shipment search feature. Blazorâ€™s ability to use C# for both client and server logic makes it a powerful tool for developing modern web applications. By leveraging components, data binding, and dependency injection, developers can build scalable and maintainable solutions in the logistics domain.
