# Introduction to Authorization in ASP.NET Core

## **1. Overview of Authorization Concepts**

Authorization is the process of determining what a user is allowed to do within an application. It complements authentication by ensuring users have the necessary permissions to access specific resources or perform actions.

### **1.1 Types of Authorization**

1. **Role-Based Authorization**:
   - Users are assigned roles (e.g., Admin, Customer).
   - Access is granted based on the user's role.
   - Example Use Case: Restricting access to admin pages.

2. **Claim-Based Authorization**:
   - Users are assigned claims, which are key-value pairs representing user attributes or permissions.
   - More granular than roles.
   - Example Use Case: Allowing only users with a claim `"CanEditOrders"` to modify orders.

3. **Policy-Based Authorization**:
   - Combines roles and claims into policies.
   - Allows for more flexible and reusable authorization logic.
   - Example Use Case: Allowing access to a resource based on a combination of roles and claims.

## **2. Role-Based and Claim-Based Authorization**

ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for implementing both role-based and claim-based authorization.

### **2.1 Role-Based Authorization**

Roles are assigned to users, and access is granted to specific resources based on these roles.

#### **Example: Using the `[Authorize]` Attribute with Roles**

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public IActionResult AdminDashboard()
{
    return View();
}
```

In this example, only users with the `Admin` role can access the `AdminDashboard` action.

### **2.2 Claim-Based Authorization**

Claims represent user-specific data, such as permissions or attributes.

#### **Example: Using the `[Authorize]` Attribute with Claims**

```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "CanViewReports")]
public IActionResult Reports()
{
    return View();
}
```

The `CanViewReports` policy must be defined in the application.

#### **Defining Policies in `Program.cs`**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("CanViewReports", policy =>
        policy.RequireClaim("Permission", "ViewReports"));
});
```

## **3. Securing Sensitive Pages: Checkout Example**

In a logistics application, sensitive pages like the checkout page should only be accessible to authorized users.

### **3.1 Restricting Access to Authenticated Users**

The `[Authorize]` attribute ensures only authenticated users can access a specific controller or action.

#### **Example: Protecting the Checkout Page**

```csharp
[Authorize]
public IActionResult Checkout()
{
    return View();
}
```

If a user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.

### **3.2 Role-Based Restriction for Admin Access**

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public IActionResult ManageOrders()
{
    return View();
}
```

This ensures only users with the `Admin` role can access the `ManageOrders` action.

### **3.3 Claim-Based Restriction for Specific Permissions**

```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "CanPlaceOrders")]
public IActionResult PlaceOrder()
{
    return View();
}
```

#### **Defining the `CanPlaceOrders` Policy**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("CanPlaceOrders", policy =>
        policy.RequireClaim("Permission", "PlaceOrders"));
});
```

## **4. Hands-On Exercise**

### **Objective:**

Students will implement role-based and claim-based authorization to secure sensitive pages in a logistics application.

### **Steps:**

1. **Define Roles and Claims:**
   - Add roles such as `Customer`, `Driver`, and `Admin`.
   - Create claims such as `CanPlaceOrders` and `CanViewReports`.

2. **Apply Authorization to Pages:**
   - Use the `[Authorize]` attribute to secure pages.
   - Define policies for claim-based access.

3. **Test Authorization:**
   - Log in with users having different roles and claims.
   - Verify access restrictions.

4. **Role Assignment (Optional):**
   - Implement a simple admin page to assign roles to users dynamically.

## **5. Use Cases in Logistics**

### **5.1 Customer Portal**

- **Authorization Need:**
  - Restrict access to the order history and shipment tracking pages to authenticated customers.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use `[Authorize]` with the `Customer` role.

### **5.2 Driver Management**

- **Authorization Need:**
  - Allow only drivers to view delivery schedules.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use `[Authorize]` with the `Driver` role.

### **5.3 Admin Dashboard**

- **Authorization Need:**
  - Grant access to sensitive admin functionalities, such as viewing financial reports and managing users.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use `[Authorize]` with the `Admin` role and claims like `"CanViewReports"`.

## **6. Summary**

Authorization in ASP.NET Core ensures secure access to resources by validating user roles and claims. By implementing role-based and claim-based authorization, developers can secure sensitive pages and functionality in a logistics application.

### **Next Steps:**

- Explore advanced policy-based authorization.
- Implement dynamic role and claim assignment for enhanced flexibility.
