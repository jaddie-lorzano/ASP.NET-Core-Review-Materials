# Comprehensive Guide to Using Methods Under IQueryable and IEnumerable

## Introduction

The use of `IQueryable` and `IEnumerable` interfaces in .NET is fundamental for effective data querying and manipulation. These interfaces allow developers to work with data collections efficiently, whether in-memory or against a database. Understanding their methods and their appropriate use cases is crucial for building robust and performant applications.

This guide delves into the various methods available under these interfaces, with sophisticated examples and complex scenarios in the logistics domain, such as managing shipments, orders, and inventory.

## **1. Methods Under IEnumerable**

`IEnumerable` is primarily used for in-memory data collections and is a foundational interface in LINQ. It works with LINQ-to-Objects.

### Common Methods

| Method               | Description                                               | Example Use Case in Logistics Domain              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Where`             | Filters elements based on a condition.                    | Get all shipments marked as "Pending."         |
| `Select`            | Projects each element into a new form.                    | Extract shipment dates from a collection.       |
| `OrderBy` / `ThenBy`| Sorts elements in ascending order.                        | Sort shipments by date and then by destination. |
| `GroupBy`           | Groups elements by a key.                                 | Group shipments by status.                      |
| `Aggregate`         | Performs a custom aggregation operation.                  | Combine all shipment tracking numbers.          |
| `First` / `FirstOrDefault` | Returns the first element or a default value if empty. | Fetch the first shipment for a specific route. |
| `Any`               | Checks if any element satisfies a condition.              | Check if any orders are overdue.                |
| `All`               | Checks if all elements satisfy a condition.               | Verify all shipments are assigned a driver.     |
| `Sum`, `Max`, `Min` | Performs arithmetic operations on collections.             | Calculate total weight of shipments.            |

### Example: Filtering and Grouping Shipments

```csharp
var shipments = new List<Shipment>
{
    new Shipment { Status = "Pending", Weight = 100 },
    new Shipment { Status = "Delivered", Weight = 200 },
    new Shipment { Status = "Pending", Weight = 150 }
};

var groupedShipments = shipments
    .Where(s => s.Status == "Pending")
    .GroupBy(s => s.Status)
    .Select(g => new { Status = g.Key, TotalWeight = g.Sum(s => s.Weight) });

foreach (var group in groupedShipments)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Status: {group.Status}, Total Weight: {group.TotalWeight}");
}
```

**Input Data:**

- Shipment 1: Status = "Pending", Weight = 100
- Shipment 2: Status = "Delivered", Weight = 200
- Shipment 3: Status = "Pending", Weight = 150

**Output:**

```
Status: Pending, Total Weight: 250
```

#### **Code Examples for Each Method**

##### `Where` Example

```csharp
var pendingShipments = shipments.Where(s => s.Status == "Pending").ToList();
```

**Output:**

- Shipment 1: Status = "Pending"
- Shipment 3: Status = "Pending"

##### `Select` Example

```csharp
var shipmentWeights = shipments.Select(s => s.Weight).ToList();
```

**Output:** `[100, 200, 150]`

##### `OrderBy` Example

```csharp
var sortedShipments = shipments.OrderBy(s => s.Weight).ToList();
```

**Output:**

1. Weight = 100
2. Weight = 150
3. Weight = 200

##### `GroupBy` Example

```csharp
var shipmentGroups = shipments.GroupBy(s => s.Status)
    .Select(g => new { Status = g.Key, Count = g.Count() });
```

**Output:**

- Pending: 2
- Delivered: 1

## **2. Methods Under IQueryable**

`IQueryable` builds on `IEnumerable` and is designed for querying data sources like databases using LINQ-to-SQL or LINQ-to-Entities.

### Common Methods

| Method               | Description                                               | Example Use Case in Logistics Domain              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Where`             | Filters data at the database level.                        | Retrieve orders shipped to a specific city.     |
| `Select`            | Projects each element into a new form.                    | Extract order IDs and delivery dates.           |
| `OrderBy` / `ThenBy`| Orders results at the database level.                      | Sort orders by priority and then by date.       |
| `GroupBy`           | Groups data by a key.                                      | Group orders by customer region.               |
| `Join`              | Joins two sequences based on a key.                       | Join orders with shipment details.             |
| `Take` / `Skip`     | Retrieves a specific number of elements.                   | Implement pagination for shipments.            |
| `First` / `FirstOrDefault` | Returns the first element from the query result.         | Fetch the first urgent order.                  |
| `Any`               | Checks if the query result contains any elements.          | Verify if there are pending shipments.         |
| `Count`             | Returns the count of elements.                             | Get the total number of shipments.             |

#### **Code Examples for Each Method**

##### `Where` Example

```csharp
var deliveredShipments = dbContext.Shipments.Where(s => s.Status == "Delivered");
```

**SQL Generated:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Shipments WHERE Status = 'Delivered';
```

##### `Select` Example

```csharp
var shipmentDates = dbContext.Shipments.Select(s => s.DeliveryDate);
```

**SQL Generated:**

```sql
SELECT DeliveryDate FROM Shipments;
```

##### `OrderBy` Example

```csharp
var sortedShipments = dbContext.Shipments.OrderBy(s => s.DeliveryDate);
```

**SQL Generated:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Shipments ORDER BY DeliveryDate ASC;
```

##### `Take` / `Skip` Example

```csharp
var paginatedShipments = dbContext.Shipments
    .OrderBy(s => s.DeliveryDate)
    .Skip(10)
    .Take(5);
```

**SQL Generated:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Shipments ORDER BY DeliveryDate OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

## **3. Advanced Usage Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: Complex Filtering with Multiple Conditions

Retrieve all shipments with a specific status, shipped within a date range, and exceeding a weight threshold.

```csharp
var filteredShipments = dbContext.Shipments
    .Where(s => s.Status == "In Transit"
        && s.ShipmentDate >= startDate
        && s.ShipmentDate <= endDate
        && s.Weight > 1000)
    .ToList();
```

**SQL Generated:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Shipments WHERE Status = 'In Transit' AND ShipmentDate BETWEEN @startDate AND @endDate AND Weight > 1000;
```

## **4. Key Differences Between IEnumerable and IQueryable**

| Feature                | IEnumerable                           | IQueryable                            |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Execution**         | Immediate                            | Deferred                              |
| **Use Case**          | In-memory data processing            | Remote data querying                  |
| **Performance**       | High memory and CPU usage for large datasets | Optimized for large datasets          |
| **Flexibility**       | Limited to in-memory operations       | Supports advanced querying            |

## **Conclusion**

Understanding and effectively using the methods under `IQueryable` and `IEnumerable` is critical for building scalable and high-performance applications. By leveraging these interfaces appropriately, you can optimize data retrieval, enhance user experience, and reduce application overhead. The logistics domain examples demonstrate how these concepts can be applied to real-world scenarios, ensuring both clarity and practical utility.
