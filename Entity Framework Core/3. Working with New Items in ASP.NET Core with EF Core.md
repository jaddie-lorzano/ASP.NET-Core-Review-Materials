# Guide: Working with New Items in ASP.NET Core with EF Core

## Module Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive module on building functionality for creating new items in a data-driven ASP.NET Core application using Entity Framework Core (EF Core). By leveraging concepts like tag helpers, model binding, and EF Core’s change tracking, we will implement a robust mechanism to add new records. This guide contextualizes these features in a logistics business domain, such as adding new shipments or categories to manage operations.

## **1. The Importance of Adding New Items**

Adding new items is fundamental for dynamic web applications that support CRUD operations. It allows users to contribute data, which is vital for maintaining accurate and up-to-date information. For example:

- **In Logistics:** Adding a new shipment to track packages.
- **In Inventory Management:** Adding a new product category to organize stock.

By structuring this process efficiently, we ensure data integrity, improve user experience, and maintain application scalability.

## **2. ASP.NET Core Features for Forms**

Forms in ASP.NET Core utilize **tag helpers** to simplify the process of creating interactive and data-driven user interfaces.

### **Tag Helpers Overview**

Tag helpers are server-side components that render HTML and integrate seamlessly with Razor views. Commonly used tag helpers include:

1. **Form Tag Helper:** Defines the action and method for the form.
2. **Input Tag Helper:** Generates input fields tied to model properties.
3. **Label Tag Helper:** Renders labels for input fields.
4. **Validation Tag Helpers:** Display validation messages.

#### Example: Creating a Form for Adding a Shipment

```razor
<form asp-controller="Shipment" asp-action="Add" method="post">
    <div>
        <label asp-for="TrackingNumber"></label>
        <input asp-for="TrackingNumber" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <label asp-for="Destination"></label>
        <input asp-for="Destination" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <button type="submit">Add Shipment</button>
    </div>
</form>
```

### **Model Binding in ASP.NET Core**

Model binding simplifies mapping incoming HTTP request data to action parameters or model properties. It supports data from form fields, route parameters, query strings, and request bodies.

#### Example: Handling Form Data in the Logistics Domain

When a user submits a form to add a shipment, model binding converts the form data into an object of type `Shipment`.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Add(Shipment shipment)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        _shipmentRepository.AddShipment(shipment);
        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }
    return View(shipment);
}
```

---

## **3. Implementing the Add Page**

The **Add Page** provides the interface and logic for creating new records. In the logistics context, this could mean adding new shipments or categories.

### **Step 1: Create a ViewModel**

ViewModels are used to encapsulate data passed between the controller and the view.

#### Example: ShipmentAddViewModel

```csharp
public class ShipmentAddViewModel
{
    [Required]
    public string TrackingNumber { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public string Destination { get; set; }

    public DateTime ShipmentDate { get; set; } = DateTime.Now;
}
```

### **Step 2: Build the Controller Action**

The controller handles GET and POST requests for the Add Page.

#### Example: ShipmentController

```csharp
public class ShipmentController : Controller
{
    private readonly IShipmentRepository _repository;

    public ShipmentController(IShipmentRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Add()
    {
        return View();
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Add(ShipmentAddViewModel model)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            var shipment = new Shipment
            {
                TrackingNumber = model.TrackingNumber,
                Destination = model.Destination,
                ShipmentDate = model.ShipmentDate
            };
            _repository.AddShipment(shipment);
            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }
        return View(model);
    }
}
```

### **Step 3: Create the Razor View**

The Razor View defines the form to capture user inputs.

#### Example: Add.cshtml

```razor
@model ShipmentAddViewModel

<h1>Add Shipment</h1>

<form asp-action="Add" method="post">
    <div>
        <label asp-for="TrackingNumber"></label>
        <input asp-for="TrackingNumber" />
        <span asp-validation-for="TrackingNumber"></span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <label asp-for="Destination"></label>
        <input asp-for="Destination" />
        <span asp-validation-for="Destination"></span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <label asp-for="ShipmentDate"></label>
        <input asp-for="ShipmentDate" type="date" />
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Add Shipment</button>
</form>
```

---

## **4. Adding Validation**

Validation ensures the data submitted by users adheres to predefined rules. ASP.NET Core supports server-side and client-side validation using attributes.

### **Step 1: Apply Validation Attributes**

Annotate the ViewModel properties with validation attributes.

#### Example: Validation for Shipments

```csharp
public class ShipmentAddViewModel
{
    [Required(ErrorMessage = "Tracking number is required")]
    [StringLength(20, ErrorMessage = "Tracking number cannot exceed 20 characters")]
    public string TrackingNumber { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = "Destination is required")]
    public string Destination { get; set; }

    public DateTime ShipmentDate { get; set; } = DateTime.Now;
}
```

### **Step 2: Display Validation Errors**

Include the `ValidationSummary` and `ValidationMessage` tag helpers in the view.

#### Example

```razor
<span asp-validation-summary="All"></span>
<span asp-validation-for="TrackingNumber"></span>
```

### **Step 3: Client-Side Validation**

Enable client-side validation by including JavaScript libraries.

#### Adding Libraries in `_Layout.cshtml`

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.validation/1.19.3/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.validation.unobtrusive/3.2.11/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"></script>
```

## **5. EF Core and the Change Tracker**

The **Change Tracker** in EF Core monitors the state of entities and coordinates database updates.

### **Entity States**

1. **Added:** Entity is new and will be inserted into the database.
2. **Modified:** Entity is updated.
3. **Deleted:** Entity is marked for deletion.
4. **Unchanged:** Entity has not been modified.
5. **Detached:** Entity is not tracked by the context.

#### Example: Adding a Shipment

```csharp
public void AddShipment(Shipment shipment)
{
    _context.Shipments.Add(shipment);
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
```

---

## **6. Handling Errors Gracefully**

Error handling ensures users are informed of issues like validation failures or database unavailability.

### **Try-Catch for Repository Errors**

Wrap database calls in a try-catch block.

#### Example

```csharp
try
{
    _context.SaveChanges();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    ModelState.AddModelError("", "An error occurred while saving the shipment.");
}
```

### **Display Errors in the UI**

Use `ViewData` to pass error messages.

#### Example

```razor
@if (ViewData["ErrorMessage"] != null)
{
    <p class="error">@ViewData["ErrorMessage"]</p>
}
```
