# Comprehensive Guide: Editing and Deleting Data in ASP.NET Core with EF Core

## Module Introduction

In building data-driven applications, the ability to edit and delete data is as crucial as creating new entries. This guide explores these functionalities in ASP.NET Core with EF Core, emphasizing techniques for handling changes efficiently and ensuring data integrity. The logistics business domain serves as the context, providing relatable examples like managing shipments, updating delivery statuses, or removing outdated inventory records.

## 1. **Editing Data**

Editing existing data involves fetching current values, displaying them to the user for modification, and saving the updated data back to the database. In ASP.NET Core, this process leverages model binding, form handling, and EF Core’s Change Tracker to ensure data consistency.

### **1.1 Process Overview**

1. **Retrieve Existing Data:** Fetch the entity using its unique identifier (e.g., shipment ID).
2. **Display for Editing:** Populate a form with the entity’s current values.
3. **Handle User Modifications:** Process the submitted form and validate the input.
4. **Save Changes:** Update the entity’s state and persist changes to the database.

---

### **1.2 Implementing Edit Functionality**

#### **Step 1: Repository Update**

Define a method for fetching and updating entities.

##### Interface Definition

```csharp
public interface IShipmentRepository
{
    Task<Shipment?> GetShipmentByIdAsync(int shipmentId);
    Task UpdateShipmentAsync(Shipment shipment);
}
```

##### Implementation

```csharp
public class ShipmentRepository : IShipmentRepository
{
    private readonly LogisticsDbContext _context;

    public ShipmentRepository(LogisticsDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<Shipment?> GetShipmentByIdAsync(int shipmentId)
    {
        return await _context.Shipments.FirstOrDefaultAsync(s => s.ShipmentId == shipmentId);
    }

    public async Task UpdateShipmentAsync(Shipment shipment)
    {
        var existingShipment = await GetShipmentByIdAsync(shipment.ShipmentId);
        if (existingShipment == null) throw new Exception("Shipment not found.");

        existingShipment.Destination = shipment.Destination;
        existingShipment.Status = shipment.Status;
        _context.Update(existingShipment);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 2: Controller Actions**

##### GET Action

Fetch and display data in an editable form.

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> Edit(int id)
{
    var shipment = await _shipmentRepository.GetShipmentByIdAsync(id);
    if (shipment == null) return NotFound();

    var viewModel = new ShipmentEditViewModel
    {
        ShipmentId = shipment.ShipmentId,
        Destination = shipment.Destination,
        Status = shipment.Status
    };

    return View(viewModel);
}
```

##### POST Action

Process user changes and save them.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> Edit(ShipmentEditViewModel viewModel)
{
    if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        return View(viewModel);

    var shipment = new Shipment
    {
        ShipmentId = viewModel.ShipmentId,
        Destination = viewModel.Destination,
        Status = viewModel.Status
    };

    try
    {
        await _shipmentRepository.UpdateShipmentAsync(shipment);
        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        ModelState.AddModelError("", ex.Message);
        return View(viewModel);
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 3: Razor View**

Use forms to capture changes.

```razor
@model ShipmentEditViewModel

<h1>Edit Shipment</h1>
<form asp-action="Edit">
    <input type="hidden" asp-for="ShipmentId" />

    <div>
        <label asp-for="Destination"></label>
        <input asp-for="Destination" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <label asp-for="Status"></label>
        <select asp-for="Status">
            <option value="Pending">Pending</option>
            <option value="In Transit">In Transit</option>
            <option value="Delivered">Delivered</option>
        </select>
    </div>

    <button type="submit">Update</button>
</form>
```

## 2. **Deleting Data**

Deleting data requires careful handling to ensure data integrity and prevent accidental loss of critical information.

### **2.1 Process Overview**

1. **Confirmation Prompt:** Avoid accidental deletions by requesting user confirmation.
2. **Validate Relationships:** Ensure related data constraints are addressed.
3. **Delete Entity:** Mark the entity for deletion and save changes.
4. **Provide Feedback:** Notify the user of successful deletion.

---

### **2.2 Implementing Delete Functionality**

#### **Step 1: Repository Update**

Define a method for deletion.

##### Interface Definition

```csharp
public interface IShipmentRepository
{
    Task DeleteShipmentAsync(int shipmentId);
}
```

##### Implementation

```csharp
public async Task DeleteShipmentAsync(int shipmentId)
{
    var shipment = await _context.Shipments.FirstOrDefaultAsync(s => s.ShipmentId == shipmentId);
    if (shipment == null) throw new Exception("Shipment not found.");

    _context.Shipments.Remove(shipment);
    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
}
```

---

#### **Step 2: Controller Actions**

##### GET Action (Confirmation Page)

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> Delete(int id)
{
    var shipment = await _shipmentRepository.GetShipmentByIdAsync(id);
    if (shipment == null) return NotFound();

    return View(shipment);
}
```

##### POST Action (Perform Deletion)

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> ConfirmDelete(int id)
{
    try
    {
        await _shipmentRepository.DeleteShipmentAsync(id);
        TempData["Message"] = "Shipment deleted successfully.";
        return RedirectToAction("Index");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        TempData["Error"] = ex.Message;
        return RedirectToAction("Delete", new { id });
    }
}
```

---

#### **Step 3: Razor View**

```razor
@model Shipment

<h1>Delete Shipment</h1>
<p>Are you sure you want to delete this shipment?</p>

<p><strong>Destination:</strong> @Model.Destination</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> @Model.Status</p>

<form asp-action="ConfirmDelete" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" asp-for="ShipmentId" />
    <button type="submit">Yes, Delete</button>
    <a asp-action="Index">Cancel</a>
</form>
```

---

### **2.3 Enhancing User Experience with JavaScript**

Add a JavaScript confirmation dialog for immediate feedback.

```html
<button type="submit" onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this shipment?');">
    Yes, Delete
</button>
```

---

## 3. **Best Practices and Considerations**

- **Validation:** Always validate user input and relationships before modifying or deleting data.
- **Transaction Safety:** Consider using database transactions for critical operations.
- **Soft Deletes:** Use a "soft delete" approach (e.g., adding an `IsDeleted` flag) if data recovery is a concern.
- **User Feedback:** Provide clear feedback after successful or failed operations.

---

## 4. **Conclusion**

Editing and deleting data are essential features in any data-driven application. By leveraging EF Core’s Change Tracker and ASP.NET Core’s robust framework, these functionalities can be implemented effectively. In the logistics domain, these features ensure data accuracy and streamline operations, making applications more user-friendly and reliable.
