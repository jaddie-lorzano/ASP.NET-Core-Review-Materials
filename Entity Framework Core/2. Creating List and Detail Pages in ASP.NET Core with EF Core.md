# Guide: Creating List and Detail Pages in ASP.NET Core with EF Core

## Module Introduction

With the groundwork laid for working with Entity Framework Core (EF Core) and a database ready with initial data, the next logical step is to build a functional administration site. This guide focuses on creating list and detail pages to interact with the database efficiently using repositories. We'll explore these concepts with examples from a logistics business domain, such as managing shipments and orders.

## **1. Understanding Repositories and Their Importance**

### **What Is a Repository?**

A repository is a class or component that encapsulates data access logic, providing an abstraction layer between the application and the data source. By centralizing data interaction code, repositories promote separation of concerns and improve maintainability.

### **Why Use Repositories?**

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps database logic out of controllers, improving code clarity.
2. **Reusability:** Common database queries can be reused across multiple parts of the application.
3. **Abstraction:** Hides the details of the ORM (e.g., EF Core) from other parts of the application, allowing flexibility to change the ORM later.

### **Example in the Logistics Domain**

In a logistics application, repositories can:

- Retrieve shipments and orders.
- Provide filtered views, such as pending or delivered shipments.

## **2. Setting Up the Repository Pattern**

### **Step 1: Create the Repository Interface**

Define the contract for the repository to ensure consistency and ease of testing.

#### Example: IShipmentRepository

```csharp
public interface IShipmentRepository
{
    Task<IEnumerable<Shipment>> GetAllShipmentsAsync();
    Task<Shipment?> GetShipmentByIdAsync(int shipmentId);
}
```

### **Step 2: Implement the Repository**

Create the concrete implementation of the interface, leveraging EF Core for data interaction.

#### Example: ShipmentRepository

```csharp
public class ShipmentRepository : IShipmentRepository
{
    private readonly LogisticsDbContext _context;

    public ShipmentRepository(LogisticsDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<IEnumerable<Shipment>> GetAllShipmentsAsync()
    {
        return await _context.Shipments
            .OrderBy(s => s.ShipmentDate)
            .ToListAsync();
    }

    public async Task<Shipment?> GetShipmentByIdAsync(int shipmentId)
    {
        return await _context.Shipments
            .Include(s => s.Orders)
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync(s => s.ShipmentId == shipmentId);
    }
}
```

### **Step 3: Register the Repository in DI Container**

Add the repository to the dependency injection (DI) container in `Program.cs`.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IShipmentRepository, ShipmentRepository>();
```

---

## **3. Creating the List Page**

The list page displays a collection of entities, such as all shipments in the logistics domain.

### **Step 1: Create the View Model**

Use a view model to shape the data for the view.

#### Example: ShipmentListViewModel

```csharp
public class ShipmentListViewModel
{
    public IEnumerable<Shipment> Shipments { get; set; } = new List<Shipment>();
}
```

### **Step 2: Add the Controller Action**

Fetch data using the repository and pass it to the view model.

#### Example: ShipmentController

```csharp
public class ShipmentController : Controller
{
    private readonly IShipmentRepository _shipmentRepository;

    public ShipmentController(IShipmentRepository shipmentRepository)
    {
        _shipmentRepository = shipmentRepository;
    }

    public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
    {
        var shipments = await _shipmentRepository.GetAllShipmentsAsync();
        var viewModel = new ShipmentListViewModel { Shipments = shipments };
        return View(viewModel);
    }
}
```

### **Step 3: Create the Razor View**

Display the list of shipments using Razor syntax.

#### Example: Index.cshtml

```razor
@model ShipmentListViewModel

<h1>Shipments</h1>

@if (!Model.Shipments.Any())
{
    <p>No shipments available.</p>
}
else
{
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Tracking Number</th>
                <th>Date</th>
                <th>Destination</th>
                <th>Actions</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        @foreach (var shipment in Model.Shipments)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>@shipment.TrackingNumber</td>
                <td>@shipment.ShipmentDate.ToShortDateString()</td>
                <td>@shipment.Destination</td>
                <td>
                    <a asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="@shipment.ShipmentId">Details</a>
                </td>
            </tr>
        }
        </tbody>
    </table>
}
```

---

## **4. Creating the Detail Page**

The detail page provides in-depth information about a single entity, such as a shipment and its associated orders.

### **Step 1: Add a View Model**

#### Example: ShipmentDetailViewModel

```csharp
public class ShipmentDetailViewModel
{
    public Shipment Shipment { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable<Order> Orders { get; set; } = new List<Order>();
}
```

### **Step 2: Add the Controller Action**

Fetch the specific entity and its related data.

#### Example: ShipmentController

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> Details(int id)
{
    var shipment = await _shipmentRepository.GetShipmentByIdAsync(id);

    if (shipment == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }

    var viewModel = new ShipmentDetailViewModel
    {
        Shipment = shipment,
        Orders = shipment.Orders
    };

    return View(viewModel);
}
```

### **Step 3: Create the Razor View**

#### Example: Details.cshtml

```razor
@model ShipmentDetailViewModel

<h1>Shipment Details</h1>

<p><strong>Tracking Number:</strong> @Model.Shipment.TrackingNumber</p>
<p><strong>Shipment Date:</strong> @Model.Shipment.ShipmentDate.ToShortDateString()</p>
<p><strong>Destination:</strong> @Model.Shipment.Destination</p>

<h2>Orders</h2>

@if (!Model.Orders.Any())
{
    <p>No orders associated with this shipment.</p>
}
else
{
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Customer Name</th>
                <th>Order Date</th>
                <th>Items</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        @foreach (var order in Model.Orders)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>@order.CustomerName</td>
                <td>@order.OrderDate.ToShortDateString()</td>
                <td>@order.Items.Count</td>
            </tr>
        }
        </tbody>
    </table>
}
```

---

## **5. Best Practices and Tips**

- **Use Asynchronous Programming:** Improves scalability and responsiveness.
- **Utilize View Models:** Ensures separation of concerns between domain models and views.
- **Apply Eager Loading:** Use `.Include()` for related data to reduce round-trips to the database.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Provide user-friendly error messages for missing or invalid data.

## **6. Conclusion**

Creating list and detail pages using ASP.NET Core and EF Core ensures a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture for data-driven applications. By applying the repository pattern and adhering to best practices, developers can efficiently manage data interaction and deliver robust solutions tailored to specific business needs, such as logistics operations.
