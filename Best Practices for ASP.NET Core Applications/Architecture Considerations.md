# Best Practices for ASP.NET Core Application Development

## **Architecture Considerations**

### **1. Introduction to Application Architecture**

A robust architecture is the cornerstone of scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications. ASP.NET Core applications benefit from a clean architecture that emphasizes modularity, separation of concerns, and dependency injection. Proper architectural decisions enable organizations to respond effectively to business changes while maintaining system integrity.

### **2. Key Principles of Application Architecture**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Divide the application into distinct layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to promote modularity and ease of maintenance. This separation ensures that changes in one layer minimally impact others.
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Use ASP.NET Core’s built-in DI container to manage dependencies effectively. This not only reduces coupling but also enhances testability and extensibility.
- **Scalability:** Design for growth by considering cloud deployment, caching, and database scaling strategies. Modern logistics systems often handle dynamic workloads, making scalability a critical factor.
- **Testability:** Use abstractions and dependency injection to make components easily testable. Testing ensures reliability and minimizes bugs during critical operations like shipment tracking or order processing.
- **Extensibility:** Plan for future feature enhancements by following SOLID principles. In logistics, this might mean adding support for new carriers or integrating with external tracking APIs.

## **3. Suggested Project Folder Structure**

A well-organized folder structure improves readability, maintainability, and team collaboration. Below is a recommended structure for a typical ASP.NET Core project:

### **Top-Level Folders**

```
SolutionName
|-- src
|   |-- ProjectName.API
|   |-- ProjectName.Application
|   |-- ProjectName.Domain
|   |-- ProjectName.Infrastructure
|
|-- tests
|   |-- ProjectName.UnitTests
|   |-- ProjectName.IntegrationTests
|
|-- docs
```

### **Detailed Structure**

#### **1. API Layer (Presentation Layer)**

Handles HTTP requests, routing, and serialization. In a logistics domain, this layer might expose endpoints for shipment tracking, order management, and user authentication.

```
ProjectName.API
|-- Controllers
|   |-- OrdersController.cs
|   |-- UsersController.cs
|-- Filters
|   |-- ExceptionFilter.cs
|-- Middleware
|   |-- CustomMiddleware.cs
|-- Startup.cs
|-- appsettings.json
```

#### **2. Application Layer (Business Logic)**

Encapsulates the application’s use cases and business rules. This layer orchestrates workflows like order placement or calculating shipping costs.

```
ProjectName.Application
|-- Interfaces
|   |-- IOrderService.cs
|   |-- IUserService.cs
|-- Services
|   |-- OrderService.cs
|   |-- UserService.cs
|-- DTOs
|   |-- OrderDto.cs
|   |-- UserDto.cs
```

#### **3. Domain Layer (Core Business Entities)**

Defines core entities, aggregates, and domain logic. For logistics, entities like `Order`, `Shipment`, and `Warehouse` will reside here.

```
ProjectName.Domain
|-- Entities
|   |-- Order.cs
|   |-- User.cs
|   |-- Shipment.cs
|-- ValueObjects
|   |-- Address.cs
|-- Exceptions
|   |-- DomainException.cs
```

#### **4. Infrastructure Layer (Data Access and External Integrations)**

Manages interactions with the database, external APIs, and other infrastructure services. For logistics, this might include integrations with carrier APIs or a centralized shipment database.

```
ProjectName.Infrastructure
|-- Data
|   |-- ApplicationDbContext.cs
|   |-- Migrations
|-- Repositories
|   |-- OrderRepository.cs
|   |-- UserRepository.cs
|   |-- ShipmentRepository.cs
|-- ExternalServices
|   |-- CarrierApiIntegration.cs
|-- Configuration
```

#### **5. Tests Folder**

Organizes unit tests and integration tests. These ensure the application behaves as expected under various scenarios.

```
tests
|-- ProjectName.UnitTests
|   |-- Services
|   |-- Controllers
|-- ProjectName.IntegrationTests
|   |-- Endpoints
```

---

## **4. Design Patterns in ASP.NET Core**

### **4.1 Dependency Injection (DI)**

Inject dependencies into controllers and services to avoid tight coupling. DI enhances maintainability and promotes clean code practices.

#### **Example:**

```csharp
public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IOrderService _orderService;

    public OrdersController(IOrderService orderService)
    {
        _orderService = orderService;
    }

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetOrderById(int id)
    {
        var order = await _orderService.GetOrderByIdAsync(id);
        return Ok(order);
    }
}
```

### **4.2 Repository Pattern**

Abstracts data access logic from the rest of the application. This is particularly useful in logistics to handle complex queries for shipments or inventory.

#### **Example:**

```csharp
public interface IOrderRepository
{
    Task<Order> GetOrderByIdAsync(int id);
}

public class OrderRepository : IOrderRepository
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public OrderRepository(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<Order> GetOrderByIdAsync(int id)
    {
        return await _context.Orders.FindAsync(id);
    }
}
```

### **4.3 Mediator Pattern**

Centralizes business logic using commands and queries. In a logistics domain, this pattern can simplify handling complex workflows like shipment tracking or order processing.

#### **Example:**

Using MediatR for CQRS:

```csharp
public class GetOrderByIdQuery : IRequest<OrderDto>
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
}

public class GetOrderByIdHandler : IRequestHandler<GetOrderByIdQuery, OrderDto>
{
    private readonly IOrderRepository _repository;

    public GetOrderByIdHandler(IOrderRepository repository)
    {
        _repository = repository;
    }

    public async Task<OrderDto> Handle(GetOrderByIdQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var order = await _repository.GetOrderByIdAsync(request.Id);
        return new OrderDto { Id = order.Id, Total = order.Total };
    }
}
```

---

## **5. Use Cases in Logistics Applications**

### **5.1 Tracking Shipments**

- **Architecture:** Separate the API for shipment tracking into its own bounded context.
- **Folder Structure:**
  - `ShipmentTracking.API`
  - `ShipmentTracking.Application`
  - `ShipmentTracking.Infrastructure`

### **5.2 Order Management System**

- **Approach:**
  - Use CQRS with MediatR to handle complex order processing logic.
  - Leverage repository patterns for data access.

#### **Controller Example:**

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Manager")]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/orders")]
public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IMediator _mediator;

    public OrdersController(IMediator mediator)
    {
        _mediator = mediator;
    }

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetOrder(int id)
    {
        var order = await _mediator.Send(new GetOrderByIdQuery { Id = id });
        return Ok(order);
    }
}
```
