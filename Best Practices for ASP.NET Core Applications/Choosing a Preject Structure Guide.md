# Guide for Choosing a Project Structure

This guide is designed to help development teams decide on the most appropriate project structure for their needs. Different structures work better for specific project sizes, team setups, and complexity levels. Below, we explore key considerations and provide guidelines for selecting between **Layered Architecture** and **Feature-Based Modular Architecture**.

## **1. Layered Architecture**

### **Overview**

Layered Architecture divides the application into horizontal layers, each with a distinct responsibility:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic.
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and orchestration logic.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Database and technical implementations.
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface and user interactions.

### **When to Use Layered Architecture**

- **Simple Projects:** Projects with limited features and straightforward logic.
- **Smaller Teams:** Ideal for teams with basic knowledge of separation of concerns.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** When you need distinct boundaries between business logic, infrastructure, and UI.
- **Testing Simplicity:** Facilitates isolated unit testing of Domain and Application layers.
- **Code Reuse:** When features share a significant amount of logic, this structure prevents duplication.

### **When NOT to Use Layered Architecture**

- **Large Projects:** It can lead to bloated layers as the number of features grows.
- **Complex Interdependencies:** Layered architecture may result in tight coupling if there’s significant interaction between features.
- **Highly Scalable Projects:** Scaling layered architecture can become challenging when adding new domains or microservices.

### **Advantages**

- Simplicity and clarity for junior developers.
- Easier to enforce **Separation of Concerns**.
- Logical grouping of responsibilities makes onboarding easier.

### **Disadvantages**

- Layers can grow large, creating maintenance challenges.
- Less flexibility to isolate or scale individual features.

## **2. Feature-Based Modular Architecture**

### **Overview**

Feature-Based Modular Architecture organizes code by features rather than layers. Each feature encapsulates its own domain, application, and infrastructure logic. Common code, such as base entities and shared services, is placed in shared libraries.

### **When to Use Feature-Based Modular Architecture**

- **Complex Applications:** Projects with many distinct features (e.g., e-commerce, logistics systems).
- **Large Teams:** Teams can work independently on separate features with minimal overlap.
- **Scalability Needs:** Modularization allows scaling individual features more easily.
- **Frequent Updates:** When features evolve independently and require frequent updates.
- **Microservices Transition:** Preparing for eventual transition to microservices architecture.

### **When NOT to Use Feature-Based Modular Architecture**

- **Small Projects:** For small projects with fewer features, modularization can introduce unnecessary complexity.
- **High Feature Interdependence:** If features share significant logic, modularization may lead to code duplication.
- **Inexperienced Teams:** Developers unfamiliar with modular design may struggle with this structure.

### **Advantages**

- Encapsulated features reduce dependencies and make the codebase more maintainable.
- Easier to scale and isolate individual features.
- Supports large teams working on separate features simultaneously.

### **Disadvantages**

- Higher initial complexity and learning curve.
- Code duplication risk if features aren’t properly abstracted.

## **3. Decision-Making Framework**

Use the following questions to guide your decision:

### **Project Characteristics**

1. **What is the size of the project?**
   - Small: Favor Layered Architecture.
   - Large: Favor Feature-Based Modular Architecture.

2. **How many features or domains does the project have?**
   - Few: Layered Architecture suffices.
   - Many: Modular Architecture handles complexity better.

3. **What is the expected growth of the project?**
   - Low Growth: Stick with Layered Architecture.
   - High Growth: Opt for Modular Architecture to accommodate scalability.

### **Team Dynamics**

4. **What is the team size?**
   - Small Team: Layered Architecture minimizes coordination.
   - Large Team: Modular Architecture enables parallel development.

5. **How experienced is the team?**
   - Less Experienced: Layered Architecture is simpler and easier to learn.
   - More Experienced: Modular Architecture offers flexibility and scalability.

### **Maintenance and Testing**

6. **What are the testing requirements?**
   - Isolated Unit Tests: Both structures support this.
   - Independent Feature Testing: Modular Architecture excels.

7. **How frequently will features evolve?**
   - Rarely: Layered Architecture works fine.
   - Frequently: Modular Architecture makes evolving features easier.

### **Performance and Scalability**

8. **Is scalability a priority?**
   - No: Layered Architecture is sufficient.
   - Yes: Modular Architecture is better suited for scaling features independently.

## **4. Hybrid Approaches**

For some projects, a hybrid approach combining elements of both structures may be ideal. For example:

- Use **Layered Architecture** for shared services and common logic.
- Modularize only **critical or high-complexity features**.

Example Hybrid Structure:

```
SolutionRoot/
├── Shared/
│   ├── Domain/
│   │   └── CommonEntities.cs
│   ├── Application/
│   │   └── SharedServices.cs
├── Features/
│   ├── Shipments/
│   │   ├── Domain/
│   │   ├── Application/
│   │   ├── Infrastructure/
│   │   └── Presentation/
│   ├── Billing/
│   │   ├── Domain/
│   │   ├── Application/
│   │   ├── Infrastructure/
│   │   └── Presentation/
└── Tests/
```
